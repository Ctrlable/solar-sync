# 🌞 Solar Sync: Enhance Your Home's Atmosphere with Smart, Sun-Synchronized Lighting 🌙


[Solar Sync](https://github.com/Ctrlable/solar-sync) is a custom component for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) that intelligently adjusts the brightness and color of your lights 💡 based on the sun's position, while still allowing for manual control.

## :arrow_down: Installation via HACS

Solar Sync is installed as a **custom repository** in [HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)](https://hacs.xyz/).

### One-click (My Home Assistant)

Click the button below — it will open HACS and pre-fill the repository URL for you:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open the Solar Sync integration inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Ctrlable&repository=solar-sync&category=integration)

### Manual steps

1. Make sure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/download/download/#to-download-hacs-core) is installed in your Home Assistant instance.
2. In the HACS panel, click the **⋮** (three-dot menu) in the top-right corner and choose **Custom repositories**.
3. Enter the URL `https://github.com/Ctrlable/solar-sync` and set the category to **Integration**, then click **Add**.
4. Search for **Solar Sync** in HACS and click **Download**.
5. Restart Home Assistant.
6. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → + Add Integration** and search for **Solar Sync**.

### Lovelace card (bundled)

The enhanced configuration card (`solar-sync-config-card`) is bundled with the integration and served automatically. After installing and restarting, add it once to your Lovelace resources:

```
/solar_sync/www/solar-sync-config-card.js   (type: module)
```

Then add a card to any dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:solar-sync-config-card
```

By automatically adapting the settings of your lights throughout the day, Solar Sync helps maintain your natural circadian rhythm 😴, which can lead to improved sleep, mood, and overall well-being. Experience cooler color temperatures at noon, gradually transitioning to warmer colors at sunset and sunrise.

In addition to its regular mode, Solar Sync also offers a "sleep mode" 🌜 which sets your lights to minimal brightness and a very warm color, perfect for winding down at night.

## :bulb: Features

When initially turning on a light that is controlled by Solar Sync, the `light.turn_on` service call is intercepted, and the light's brightness and color are automatically adjusted based on the sun's position.
After that, the light's brightness and color are automatically adjusted at a regular interval.

Solar Sync provides four switches (using "living_room" as an example component name):

- `switch.solar_sync_living_room`: Turn Solar Sync on or off and view current light settings through its attributes.
- `switch.solar_sync_sleep_mode_living_room`: Activate "sleep mode" 😴 and set custom sleep_brightness and sleep_color_temp.
- `switch.solar_sync_adapt_brightness_living_room`: Enable or disable brightness adaptation 🔆 for supported lights.
- `switch.solar_sync_adapt_color_living_room`: Enable or disable color adaptation 🌈 for supported lights.

<!-- SECTION:manual-control:START -->
### :control_knobs: Regain Manual Control

Solar Sync is designed to automatically detect when you or another source (e.g., automation) manually changes light settings 🕹️.
When this occurs, the affected light is marked as "manually controlled," and Solar Sync will not make further adjustments until the light is turned off and back on or reset using the `solar_sync.set_manual_control` service call.
This feature is available when `take_over_control` is enabled.

Additionally, enabling `detect_non_ha_changes` allows Solar Sync to detect all state changes, including those made outside of Home Assistant, by comparing the light's state to its previously used settings.
The `solar_sync.manual_control` event is fired when a light is marked as "manually controlled," allowing for integration with automations 🤖.

> ⚠️ **_Caution: Some lights might falsely indicate an 'on' state, which could result in lights turning on unexpectedly. Disable `detect_non_ha_changes` if you encounter such issues._**

## :gear: Configuration

Solar Sync supports configuration through both YAML and the frontend (**Settings** -> **Devices and Services** -> **Solar Sync**, **Solar Sync** -> **Options**), with identical option names in both methods.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
solar_sync:
  lights:
    - light.living_room_lights
```
Note: If you plan to strictly use the UI, the `solar_sync:` entry must still be added to the YAML.

Transform your home's atmosphere with Solar Sync 🏠, and experience the benefits of intelligent, sun-synchronized lighting today!

### :memo: Options

### :exclamation: Common Problems & Solutions

#### :bulb: Lights Not Responding or Turning On by Themselves

Solar Sync sends more commands to lights than a typical human user would. If your light control network is unhealthy, you may experience:

- Laggy manual commands (e.g., turning lights on or off).
- Unresponsive lights.
- Home Assistant reporting incorrect light states, causing Solar Sync to inadvertently turn lights back on.

Most issues that appear to be caused by Solar Sync are actually due to unrelated problems.
Addressing these issues will significantly improve your Home Assistant experience.

In case lights are suddenly turning on by themselves, this is most likely due to the light incorrectly reporting an "on" state to Home Assistant, leading to an undesired Solar Sync action.
To prevent adapting in cases *where the state of the light is suddenly "on" and only adapt if there is an associated `light.turn_on` service call*, set `detect_non_ha_changes: false`.

#### :signal_strength: WiFi Networks

Ensure your light bulbs have a strong WiFi connection. If the signal strength is less than -70dBm, the connection may be weak and prone to dropping messages.

#### :spider_web: Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Other Mesh Networks

Mesh networks typically require powered devices to act as routers, relaying messages back to the central coordinator (the radio connected to Home Assistant).
Most modern lights function as routers, very early models may not.
If devices become unresponsive or fail to respond to commands, Solar Sync can exacerbate the issue.
Use network maps (available in ZHA, zigbee2mqtt, deCONZ, and ZWaveJS UI) to evaluate your network health.
Smart plugs can be an affordable way to add more routers to your network.

For most Zigbee networks, **using groups is essential for optimal performance**.
For example, if you want to use Solar Sync in a hallway with six bulbs, adding each bulb individually to the Solar Sync configuration could overwhelm the network with commands.
Instead, create a group in your Zigbee software (not a regular Home Assistant group) and add that single group to the Solar Sync configuration.
This sends a single broadcast command to adjust all bulbs, improving response times and keeping the bulbs in sync.

As a rule of thumb, if you always control lights together (e.g., bulbs in a ceiling fixture), they should be in a Zigbee group.
Expose only the group (not individual bulbs) in Home Assistant Dashboards and external systems like Google Home or Apple HomeKit.

> :warning: **If you control lights individually, `manual_control` cannot behave correctly! If you need to control lights individually as well, use a [Home Assistant Light Group](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/group/).**

#### :rainbow: Light Colors Not Matching

Bulbs from different manufacturers or models may have varying color temperature specifications. For instance, if you have two Solar Sync configurations—one with only Philips Hue White Ambiance bulbs and another with a mix of Philips Hue White Ambiance and Sengled bulbs—the Philips Hue bulbs may appear to have different color temperatures despite having identical settings.

To resolve this:

1.  Include only bulbs of the same make and model in a single Solar Sync configuration.
2.  Rearrange bulbs so that different color temperatures are not visible simultaneously.

#### :bulb: Bulb-Specific Issues

These lights are known to exhibit disadvantageous behaviour due to firmware bugs, insufficient functionality, or hardware limitations:

- [Sengled Z01-A19NAE26](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/Z01-A19NAE26.html#sengled-z01-a19nae26)
  - Unexpected turn-ons: If Solar Sync sends a long transition time (like the default 45 seconds), and the bulb is turned off during that time, it may turn back on after approximately 10 seconds to continue the transition command. Since the bulb is turning itself on, there will be no obvious trigger in Home Assistant or other logs indicating the cause of the light turning on. To fix this, set a much shorter `transition` time, such as 1 second.
  - Heat sensitivity: Additionally, these bulbs may perform poorly in enclosed "dome" style ceiling lights, particularly when hot. While most LEDs (even non-smart ones) state in the fine print that they do not support working in enclosed fixtures, in practice, more expensive bulbs like Philips Hue generally perform better. To resolve this issue, move the problematic bulbs to open-air fixtures.
- Ikea Tradfri bulbs/drivers (and related Ikea smart light products)
  - Unsupported simultaneous transition of brightness and color: When receiving such a command, they switch the brightness instantly and only transition the color. To get smooth transitions of both brightness and color, enable `separate_turn_on_commands`.
  - Unresponsiveness during color transitions: No other commands are processed during an ongoing color transition, e.g., turn-off commands are ignored and lights stay on despite being reported as off to Home Assistant. The default config with long transitions thus results in long periods of unresponsiveness. To work around this, disable transitions by setting `transition` to `0`, and increase the adaptation frequency by setting `interval` to a short time, e.g., `15` seconds, to retain the impression of smooth continuous adaptations. Keeping the `initial_transition` is recommended for a smooth fade-in (lights are usually not turned off momentarily after being turned on, in which case a short period of unresponsiveness is tolerable).

### Custom brightness ramps using `brightness_mode` with `"linear"` and `"tanh"`

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Enhance your control over brightness transitions during sunrise and sunset with <code>brightness_mode</code> (click here to learn more 🧠).</summary>

With Solar Sync, you can set a `brightness_mode` to specify how the brightness changes during sunrise and sunset. The `brightness_mode` can be set to `"default"` ([as illustrated in other graphs above](#high_brightness-brightness)), `"linear"`, or `"tanh"`. If you choose to deviate from the `"default"` mode, you can adjust `brightness_mode_time_dark` and `brightness_mode_time_light` to further customize the lighting transitions.

When `brightness_mode` is set to `"linear"`:

- During **_sunset_**, the brightness begins to gradually decrease from `max_brightness` starting at `time=sunset_time - brightness_mode_time_light`, until it reaches `min_brightness` at `time=sunset_time + brightness_mode_time_dark`.
- During **_sunrise_**, the brightness begins to gradually increase from `min_brightness` starting at `time=sunrise_time - brightness_mode_time_dark`, until it reaches `max_brightness` at `time=sunrise_time + brightness_mode_time_light`.

When `brightness_mode` is set to `"tanh"`, it uses the smooth transition of a [hyperbolic tangent function](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HyperbolicTangent.html):

- During **_sunset_**, the brightness starts to decrease from 95% of `max_brightness` starting at `time=sunset_time - brightness_mode_time_light`, until it reaches 5% of `min_brightness` at `time=sunset_time + brightness_mode_time_dark`.
- During **_sunrise_**, the brightness starts to increase from 5% of `min_brightness` starting at `time=sunrise_time - brightness_mode_time_dark`, until it reaches 95% of `max_brightness` at `time=sunrise_time + brightness_mode_time_light`.
</details>

Notice the values of `brightness_mode_time_light` and `brightness_mode_time_dark` in the text box.
